+ Title             : Write a Javascript program to design a nim game.
+ Description       : Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps, which has rules:
                      There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3stones.
                      The one who removes the last stone will be the winner.
                      You will take the first turn to remove the stones. Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Continue the game until the last stone is removed.
                      Special Case : If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
